"""Regression tests for scripts/bench-compare.sh's measurement-integrity guard.

The guard exists because cargo's exit status is necessary and not sufficient. A
bench invocation whose Criterion filter matches nothing exits 0 having measured
nothing, and the target then contributes no Criterion comparison at all — so a
downstream gate that reconciles comparisons FOUND against comparisons JUDGED
cannot see the omission: absence leaves no artifact to be found missing. The
only place the run's intent is still known is the invocation itself.

These tests drive the real script, not an extracted copy of the helper. The
script derives its repo root from its own location, so each case builds a
disposable git repo, copies the shipping script and its lib/ into it, and puts a
stub `cargo` on PATH that exits 0 and prints no measurement lines — exactly the
shape that used to pass.
